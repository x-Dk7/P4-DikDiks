# P4 DikDiks
   # WELCOME TO THE MARIO MUSEUM!
    Our group will focus on creative development (We will achieve this through collaboration), data (We will achieve this by investigating computing innovations), algorithms and programming (We will do this through strings, abstraction, lists, and procedures), computing systems and networks (We will use the internet as our main network to gather info), and the impact of computing (Our program will be beneficial for those who would like to know more about the video game industry). 
    Our project will focus on the mainline Mario games. We are planning on making a website that contains soundtracks, gameplay, and info of each listed game. We plan on adding sprites to make the website and mini-game more appealing to the players, and we will collaborate together to make the website the best it can be. The selected games that we will be using in our website are: Super Mario 64, Mario Odyssey, Mario Galaxy, Mario Sunshine, and our own little Mini-game add-on. It will be a timed game to see how many coins the user can grab in a certain interval of time within a restrained box that the player can jump around. There will be a leaderboard that will refresh after each player has played so it can list players’ highscores through a set database.

Monday, Febuary 1st (Week 8)- Completing Tickets and Easter Egg Week
   
   Jacob - I tried to point the domain name to the website hosting, but I am still struggling a little. I obtained the Amazon Web Service to try and run our website online which can run the code.

   Mustafa - This week I fully completed the navbar as well as updating the links and making the navbar easier to access all across the website. I updated the back to home button and I made the navbar accessable across all subpages on the website.

   Jason - First goal for connecting MySQL to the website was moved to goals for next week. It was replaced with creating a light and dark mode button for my test website so I could implement it to the official one.

Monday, January 11th (Week 5)

Scrum Team Cards/Tickets for the Week:

   Jacob (20/20) - Make at least base subpage for the mario games that connect to the main homepage and have information on that mario game. Mario Museum Repository: https://github.com/nguyenjacob/MarioMuseum This repository has the code that I've been working on this week. With this code, I managed to make different subpages for the 4 mario games as well as embedding each of the games' original soundtrack. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PCOS9khjjs Video of my code deployment.
   
   Mustafa (18/20) - Make a Navigation Bar for the webpage. Currently have the links et up, however, when clicking on the link, it doesn't take you to the other pages. This will be fixed soon. Here is a link to the Youtube tutorial I followed to get this navbar set up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg
   
   Jason (19/20) - I mostly dedicated my time to coding in MySQL and figuring out how to gather data someway through my code. This was my scrum board goal. I was somewhat successful.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bqTv_FH09Lna3JLCgFsxR-HSP2P9npcYaC5cuVIpaX4/edit?usp=sharing
   
   Dk (18/20) - I will try to figure out how to make the minigame for our Mario museum that includes code from HTML and Python. Mainly focusing on figuring out how to implement user interaction with HTML and Python. I’m going to try and focus on making the mini-game that includes user interaction and data storage. I've been watching YouTube videos on how to implement user interaction with Python and HTML5 so our mini-game runs smoother and attracts more people to play it. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OX49nLNPEE & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Fn33lYuE0) I have some code for the mini-game set up: (https://github.com/x-Dk7/P4-DikDiks/tree/main/mini-game), all I need to do is import a mario character sprite and add data storage like a leaderboard.

Friday, December 11th (Week 1)
Project Plan
   
   Beginning: Create a website with our title and outline of the whole project
   
   Midterm: Have some of the basic information of the Mario Games prepared and have the blueprint of our mini-game ready to code by the six week mark.
   
   N@TM: Make sure we have our whole Mario Museum complete including: Embedded soundtracks, videos as well as the images; our mini-game must be completely done and ready for users to play and have all the information needed for the website.
   
   Big Ticket Items: Our big ticket item will be the mini-game we're creating that can store and show the data of the players which will be our most appealing item.
   
   Scrum Board Link:
   - Using padlet, we will be able to track big ticket items on our scrum board (trello). The padlet will be used to keep track of our goals for the week and will update as we work on the project. Our 2 main big ticket items are the leaderboard and data web scrapping.
   
   College Board: Our group will focus on creative development (We will achieve this through collaboration), data (We will achieve this by investigating computing innovations), algorithms and programming (We will do this through strings, abstraction, lists, and procedures), computing systems and networks (We will use the internet as our main network to gather info), and the impact of computing (Our program will be beneficial for those who would like to know more about the video game industry).
   
   CB Big Idea #1: Collaboration with scrum teams and worked on figuring out how to make and design our website. Website will use HTML and Python so we can have a user-friendly quick repsonse website. The website will have a live database that will update after every user has entered their data after the mini-game. Users will be able to see info about the Mario Games, and there will be a menu set up so users can scroll through the games.
   
   CB Big Idea #2: In order to improve our knowledge on coding, we will use and learn more about CRUD. Both CRUD and the minigame we are creating both implement data-driven UI and incorporate large quantities of data.
   
   CB Big Idea #3: Created storyboard to consider our ideas of the website. The homepage will have a large title of the project, the group members, and a general description of the Mario series. Summarization of mario games in seperate subpages. HTML will be used. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xys8txhzQTyU4i30_sKqmHkE3WzJbl7l09plkWrdwJ0/edit?usp=sharing (Link to the storyboard);
   
   CB Big Idea #4: In order to set up a website on a rasberry pi server more efficiently, we will use NGINX. Link: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/nginx.md
   
   CB Big Idea #5: Our project will most likely have a greater impact outside of the classroom environment. Those who want to know more about the Mario Brothers series, play fun games, or listen to Mario music in the soundtrack will visit our website. Under each subsection of the website, we will include a link to the Youtube channel providing the music and gameplay as well as other websites that provide more in depth looks in the Mario series.
