   # WELCOME TO THE MARIO MUSEUM!
    Our group will focus on creative development (We will achieve this through collaboration), data (We will achieve this by investigating computing innovations), algorithms and programming (We will do this through strings, abstraction, lists, and procedures), computing systems and networks (We will use the internet as our main network to gather info), and the impact of computing (Our program will be beneficial for those who would like to know more about the video game industry). 
    Our project will focus on the mainline Mario games. We are planning on making a website that contains soundtracks, gameplay, and info of each listed game. We plan on adding sprites to make the website and mini-game more appealing to the players, and we will collaborate together to make the website the best it can be. The selected games that we will be using in our website are: Super Mario 64, Mario Odyssey, Mario Galaxy, Mario Sunshine, and our own little Mini-game add-on. Our mini-game will include a character selection ranging from characters like Mario, Luigi, and Toad. I will be a timed game to see how many coins the user can grab in a certain interval of time within a restrained box that the player can jump around. There will be a live-time leaderboard that will refresh after each player has played so it can list playersâ€™ highscores through a set database.
